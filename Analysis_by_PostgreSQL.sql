-- ✅ Conclusion: Your Empty Tables Are Likely Accurate
-- This isn't a failure — it's actually a very useful insight for your final report.

-- ✍️ How to Report This (Professional Insight)
-- ❝ After conducting a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of Apple iTunes music sales, we found that the existing invoice and playlist records exclusively reference placeholder or incomplete track records. No valid (non-dummy) track metadata was linked to revenue-generating transactions or playlists. This suggests either a data import issue or that the original data source lacked corresponding content. ❞
